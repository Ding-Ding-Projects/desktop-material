# Desktop Material — Completed Feature Plan

## Final status

The feature-expansion roadmap is complete. Milestones **M0 through M18 are
shipped on `main`** through pre-documentation integration SHA
`4da59bd38308fff45b48f09819d08cbc356ee946`. There is no remaining queued,
partial, or in-flight implementation work in this plan.

The only work intentionally left outside the milestone ledger is the
root-integrator publication gate after this final documentation merge: verify
the resulting `main` SHA, CI, Pages, canonical wiki publication, public assets,
and the final accessibility/clipping audit. Those checks must be recorded from
the post-merge SHA and are not claimed by this pre-merge document.

## Additional completed product work

- The per-repository `.gitignore` manager, template catalogue, suggestions, and
  reversible marker-section merge live in `app/src/lib/gitignore/` and
  `app/src/ui/repository-settings/`.
- Build & Run detects Node, Rust, Go, .NET, Python, Java, Make, and CMake
  projects; handles multiple .NET projects; can install missing toolchains;
  streams logs; minimizes; and stores per-repository settings under
  `app/src/lib/build-run/`, `app/src/main-process/`, and
  `app/src/ui/build-run/`.
- Fork update checks and release feeds point to the Desktop Material repository,
  not the upstream GitHub Desktop updater.
- Account selection, profile mutation serialization, export rendering,
  provider routing, submodule display, repository tooltips, and other integration
  regressions found during the merge waves were fixed before the final build.

## Architecture contracts that remain authoritative

1. Account identity is `getAccountKey(account) = endpoint#id`; provider ports do
   not fall back to login-only identity.
2. Profile settings, tabs, flushes, history actions, and multi-window mutations
   use the same serialized profile queue.
3. `VersionedStoreHistory` remains the shared settings/notification history UI.
4. Batch clone consumes sanitized URL-only items; exports never contain tokens.
5. Filter modes and regex parsing use the shared bounded search infrastructure.
6. Automation posts results to the notification centre and never lets a
   background failure block the foreground UI.
7. Agent access stays localhost-only, opt-in, token-gated, origin-checked,
   size-bounded, and redacted.
8. Desktop Plus behavior is adapted under its MIT license, but visuals continue
   to use Desktop Material's `--md-sys-*` token system.
9. No token may be written to a profile repository, notification repository,
   export file, screenshot, log, or agent response.

## Final integrated validation evidence

The pre-documentation integration run at `4da59bd383` recorded:

- validation scope: **239 files**;
- unit suite: **1,850 tests — 1,849 passed, 0 failed, 1 intentional skip**;
- repository-wide `yarn lint`: **passed**;
- `yarn tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck`: **passed**;
- production unpackaged build: **passed**, using
  `npx --no-install cross-env RELEASE_CHANNEL=development DESKTOP_SKIP_PACKAGE=1 yarn build:prod`;
- the build and GUI verification path used the exact low-level MCP checkout at
  SHA `beed66ca6ed2503e6170ee1e1158247f1c2f0140`;
- all promoted final milestone captures were inspected at original resolution,
  were nonblank, contained no private data, and measured **1443×992**.

## Root-finalized publication gate

After this documentation branch is merged, the root integrator must close the
handoff against the resulting `main` SHA:

1. Confirm local `main`, `origin/main`, and the pushed documentation SHA match.
2. Confirm applicable CI and Pages workflows succeeded for that exact SHA; do
   not substitute an older green run.
3. Confirm the public README and Pages site render the final feature ledger and
   each referenced screenshot returns HTTP 200 with the tracked SHA-256.
4. Push the canonical `docs/wiki/` mirror to the GitHub wiki and verify the live
   pages and raw-main image references.
5. Run the final accessibility and clipping audit: keyboard reachability,
   accessible names/roles, focus visibility, dark/light contrast, text and
   controls at 50–200% scaling, no clipped rows/FABs/search controls/log panels,
   and no horizontal overflow at the supported minimum viewport and the
   **1443×992** verification viewport.
6. Record the exact workflow URLs, wiki commit, public URLs, response status,
   and asset hashes in the final root handoff.

Until those post-merge checks are complete, this plan claims the implementation
and local/headless validation as shipped, but does not claim final public
publication for the documentation merge.
